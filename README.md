# ColorShape
Color shape is a beautifully minimalist grid game that is sure to keep you coming back for more. This time-based game becomes more and more addictive as you get higher scores. The rules are simple:

- Tap to change the color of the tiles on the grid until you reach the goal combination. A goal that says, "4 Blue In A Row‚Äù, means you need to get 4 blue tiles in either a horizontal or vertical row. 

- You gain points once you complete a goal and lose points every time you tap a tile. Be careful where you tap!

- Get the highest score possible. 

There are 3 different modes:

Easy Mode: Play this mode to familiarize yourself with the mechanics and to build up your skills. This mode will offer a satisfying challenge.

Medium Mode: The time ticker goes down faster in this mode, so you must be a quick thinker with good reflexes. Improve your skills by playing this mode before you move on to the next mode. 

Grand Master Mode: This is the most difficult mode and must be played with caution. The time ticker goes down the fastest here. While frustratingly difficult, the relief when mastered is awesome!
